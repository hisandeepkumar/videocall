# 📹 Quantum Video Call

**Quantum Video Call** is a modern peer-to-peer video calling web application built using WebRTC (via PeerJS). It features a clean Apple-style glassmorphism UI, smart video swapping, and essential real-time call controls — all within a lightweight, serverless environment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Calling** – Direct connection between browsers using WebRTC.
- **Stylish Glassmorphism UI** – Clean, minimal, and mobile-friendly interface.
- **Animated Gradient Background** – Subtle motion effect adds modern aesthetics.
- **Video Swap** – Tap on the local video to swap it with the remote video.
- **Mute / Unmute Microphone** – Toggle mic with one click.
- **Camera Switching** – Switch between front and back cameras (mobile supported).
- **Call Timer** – Shows real-time duration of the active call.
- **Call End for Both** – One tap to end the call on both sides.
- **Fullscreen Mode** – Seamless fullscreen experience for better immersion.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. When the app loads, it generates a unique Peer ID.
2. The caller shares a call link containing this ID.
3. The receiver opens the link to automatically connect.
4. Once connected, both users exchange video/audio streams directly via WebRTC.
5. Users can interact through the UI — mute, switch camera, fullscreen, and end the call.

## 🛡️ Security Aspects

- **End-to-End Communication**: This app uses WebRTC, which establishes a **direct encrypted connection** between peers. Media streams are not routed through any server.
- **No Data Storage**: No backend or database means no risk of data breaches, hacking, or surveillance. Nothing is stored — ever.
- **HTTPS Required**: The app requires a secure HTTPS connection to access camera and microphone, ensuring safe communication.
- **No Account / Login**: Users don’t need to create an account, which eliminates risks related to credentials and identity theft.

> ✅ *Quantum Video Call is ideal for temporary, anonymous, and secure 1-on-1 communication.*
